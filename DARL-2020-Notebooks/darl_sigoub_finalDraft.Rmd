## Overview and Problems Tackled
This semester, main contributions involve dataset collection and dataset analytics. As the project is oriented towards anaylizing tweets and their responses, my job was to scope our dataset to relevent tweeters while retrieving new tweets as necessary from the Twitter API to complete the tweet-response pair representations in elasticsearch.
