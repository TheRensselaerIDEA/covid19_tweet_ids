## Personal Contributions

  * Researched articles on coronavirus tweet data analysis and mask sentiment in the US
  * Did statistical analysis on mean sentiment of tweets per week over time, and will do a statstical analysis on mean sentiment of anti and positive mask sentiment tweets per week over time
  * Usage of statistical analysis code such as ANOVA, Pairwise T Test, Residuals vs Fit Plot, and Normality tests

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * What did you want to know? I wanted to know whether there was significant differences in mean sentiment of twitter mask data per week over time
    * How did you go about finding it? Used an ANOVA and associated assumption tests
    * What did you find? I found that there is a statistical difference between mean sentiments per week, and that assumptions of normal residuals, no outliers, and homogeneity of variances were met.
